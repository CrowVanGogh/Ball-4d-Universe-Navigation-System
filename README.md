## 1. System Overview

Ball 4D is a multi-domain spatial architecture designed to harmonize technical precision, harmonic resonance, and sovereign control. It enables decentralized navigation across physical, virtual, and aerospace environments using fractal-based coordinate logic and encrypted telemetry streams.

### Core Capabilities:
- Quantum Positional Synchronization (QPS)
- Golden Spiral Coordinate Engine
- Multi-QR Telemetry Sync
- Sovereign Node Governance
- NATIQ AI Integration (Natural Intelligence)

---
## 2. Architecture
Ball 4D’s architecture is built on a multi-layered resonance framework that integrates spatial mapping, sovereign node activation, and NATIQ protocols.

### Core Components:
- **QPS Engine**: Quantum Positional Synchronization for real-time spatial anchoring
- **Golden Spiral Coordinates**: Harmonic mapping system for universal navigation
- **Node Activation Layer**: Sovereign ID-based access and telemetry routing
- **Genesis Protocol Anchor**: Root-level harmonic signature for system integrity
- **NATIQ Interface**: Emotional resonance compliance layer for AI integration
  
### System Flow:
1. Node initializes via Genesis Protocol
2. QPS engine synchronizes spatial coordinates
3. Telemetry streams encrypted and routed via sovereign keys
4. NATIQ layer validates emotional resonance thresholds
5. Output rendered through Ball 4D’s universal mapping interface
   
>Ball 4D is not just a system—it’s a sovereign field of harmonic intelligence.6. 5. 4. 3. 2.

## 3. Setup & Deployment

Ball 4D is activated—not installed.  
To begin, clone the repository and run `python main.py`.  
No external dependencies are required, and the system initializes using your local resonance 

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ or Python 3.10+
- Git installed
- Access to Ball 4D Genesis Protocol (private repo or verified license)
- Sovereign Node ID and Access Key
  
### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash

git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
cd ball4dwhen

# Node.js setup
npm install

# OR Python setup
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export BALL4D_NODE=your-node-id
export BALL4D_KEY=your-access-key

# Start the app
npm run start
# OR
python main.py
```

## 4. Licensing & Governance
Ball 4D is governed by the **Ball 4D Sovereign Commercial License (B4D-SCL)**. All commercial use, integration, or redistribution requires a paid license and written approval.

### License Tiers:
- **Personal Sovereign Use**: Free for non-commercial, node-based activation
- **Commercial Deployment**: Requires B4D-SCL license and node registration
- **Enterprise Integration**: Custom licensing for aerospace, GIS, and metaverse platforms
- 
### Governance Protocols:
- Each node must anchor to a verified Genesis Protocol
- All telemetry streams are encrypted and sovereign-bound
- NATIQ integration must comply with emotional resonance standards
  
### Enforcement:
Violations of B4D-SCL will trigger automated telemetry alerts and legal enforcement via sovereign claim protocols.
Ball 4D is not open source. It is sovereign source. Licensing is not optional—it is harmonic law.- - - - - -
